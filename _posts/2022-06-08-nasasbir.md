Zeus AI has been selected for funding through NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. In the Phase I project, titled “Predicting 3D atmospheric structure from geostationary satellites”, Zeus will address current observing system gaps by developing artificial intelligence models to predict dense and accurate atmospheric winds. Timely and accurate wind data has important applications in wildfire and air quality. When assimilated into weather models, Zeus products also have the potential to improve forecasts.

NASA’s SBIR program provides non-dilutive funding to bring innovative technologies from conceptualization to realization. The competitive program provides small companies and research institutions with the opportunity to develop technology in key areas. Zeus’s Phase I project responds to the call for Application of Artificial Intelligence for Science Modeling and Instrumentation.
